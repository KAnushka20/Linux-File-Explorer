Linux is a free, open-source operating system kernel originally developed by Linus Torvalds in 1991. It forms the foundation for a wide range of distributions (distros) like Ubuntu, Fedora, and Debian, which are used on desktops, servers, smartphones, and embedded devices worldwide. Known for its stability, security, and customizability, Linux powers much of the internet's infrastructure and is favored by developers for its flexibility, allowing users to modify and distribute the code freely under licenses like GPL. It's a cornerstone of open-source software, promoting collaboration and innovation in computing.
